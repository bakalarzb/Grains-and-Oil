                <h3>1. Reduce Single-Use Plastics</h3>
                <p>Plastic production is a significant and growing contributor to climate change, and microplastics endanger nature and human health alike. But what are we to do when so many essential consumer items are bundled in and born out of this hard-to-recycle material? First, don’t despair—then, stand with TNC and others in calling on world leaders to give consumers better options than the plastic industry. Use our tips below to get started in your home and community.

                <h3>2. Say “Not So Fast” to Fast Fashion</h3>
                <p>Fast fashion relies on the rapid production of clothing, demands vast amounts of natural resources and is often made from synthetic materials like polyester, which release microplastics. These microplastics, invisible to the naked eye, are toxic and pose a major threat to the environment. During clothing manufacturing, microfibers and plastics are released and estimates indicate that textile production is on track to triple by 2050. Fast fashion also promotes a throwaway culture, where clothes are quickly discarded after a few uses, leading to massive textile waste. Millions of tons of discarded clothes end up in landfills, taking hundreds of years to decompose and releasing harmful greenhouse gases and toxins.

                <h3>3. Make Sustainable Purchases </h3>
                <p>In addition to making more sustainable decisions around your clothing purchases, you can also make sustainable choices for your other needs, such as buying products locally and in bulk.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Reduce Your Food Waste</h3>
                <p>Globally, around 931 million tonnes of food is wasted each year. In the US alone, approximately 60 million tons of food is wasted annually, equating to nearly 40% of the entire US food supply. When this waste ends up in landfills, it contributes to greenhouse gas emissions that accelerate climate change. Learn how to build a sustainable diet with the tips below.

                <h3>5. Address Wastewater</h3>
                <p>Sewage pollution threatens biodiversity, especially in the ocean. While the environmental impact is significant, transformational solutions exist!
                </p>

                <h3>6. Go Digital </h3>
                <p>Reducing your paper waste by switching from printed materials to digital formats can significantly reduce your carbon emissions. While digital devices do consume energy, the overall energy usage is much lower compared to the entire lifecycle of printed materials.
                </p>

                <h3>7. Talk Trash</h3>
                <p>Talking trash <i>(literally)</i> can save the planet! Your casual conservations about waste can be a huge game changer for our planet. When we talk about our carbon footprints and the impact of our daily habits—especially at the community scale and beyond—we start to see the bigger picture. When you share these small victories with friends and family, you can spark a ripple effect, inspiring others to make eco-friendly choices and even pushing for bigger changes in our communities.
                </p>

                <h3>8. Challenge Leaders to Do Better</h3>
                <p>Challenging leaders to improve their approach to waste management can make a significant difference by sparking accountability and innovation. When leaders are pushed to set higher standards, they are more likely to implement effective policies and invest in sustainable technologies. By holding leaders accountable, we can drive systemic changes that lead to more efficient resource use, reduced pollution, and a healthier planet for future generations.
